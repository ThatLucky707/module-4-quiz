My quiz includes a series of questions about coding for the participant to answer in order to achieve a score.

I have included a title, a series of questions and multiple choice answers to choose from for each question.
Each question has four possible answers.

There is a timer connected to the quiz which is set to begin once the quiz has begun.

I have included a CSS stylesheet to add some customization.
